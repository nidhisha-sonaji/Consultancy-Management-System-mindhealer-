                In general, counseling is recommended for specific issues and situations, such as addiction or grief, and takes place over weeks to several months.
Psychotherapy, in contrast, tends to explore past issues that might be contributing to present day problems. It often takes place continually or intermittently over a period of years.

                <b>
                    While the same therapist may provide both counseling and psychotherapy, psychotherapy generally requires more skill than simple counseling.1ï»¿ It is conducted by professionals trained to practice psychotherapy such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, a trained counselor, or a social worker.
While a psychotherapist is qualified to provide counseling, a counselor may or may not possess the necessary training and skills to provide psychotherapy.

<h3>How to Choose Between a Counselor and Psychotherapist?</h3>
<big>
    <p>
        <b>
            When choosing a therapist, it's helpful to learn about the differences noted above, as well as the background of specific providers and the approaches they use. Sometimes the choice will come down to personal preferences, access, or insurance coverage.
The most important step, however, is to find a therapist you can trust. In fact, the level of trust a person has in their mental health care practitioner plays the greatest role in whether the therapy will be successful or not.
You may actually need to talk with a provider or visit for a few appointments before you know which type of therapy is best for you. For example, with some situations it can be difficult to know if it is a short term, a limited problem you are facing (and thus, may fall under conditions best treated with counseling), or if instead there are events or situations in your past that are leading to the current problem.

You wish to learn coping skills to help better manage stress and improve relationships
You are coping with life transitions and adjustments, such as divorce or grief
You are coping with addiction issues
You are looking for someone who is essentially a "coach" who can guide and support you as you learn to recognize problems and formulate healthy solutions yourself
