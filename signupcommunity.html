        <h3> World Mental Health Day is observed on October 10. </h3>
        <big><p>This day is meant to raise awareness about the importance of mental health of individuals across the world. This World Mental Health Day, we talk about the minds of children and how parents or caretakers can ensure that children are healthy both physically and mentally. Behavior in kids might be difficult to analyze. Actions such as anxiety, anger, and shyness can be a part of developmental growth and a temporary condition rather than an illness. But when troubling behaviors occur over a period of time or in a way that disrupts daily life, they are considered symptoms of mental illness or a disorder.<br>

               <br> Conditions that are seen in adults may alsoWorld Mental Health Day: Pediatrician Dr. Gorika Bansal elaborates on symptoms of poor mental health in children and how parents and caretakers can take care of children's physical and psychological health.<br>
                 be seen in children and adolescents. It is difficult to diagnose depression in kids as they tend to show irritability, anger or headaches. Whereas in adults, common symptoms of depression are low mood and sadness. So as caretakers you should be aware and vigilant enough to understand if there are any changes in your kids' behavior or s/he is exhibiting any kind of mood swings or sleep issues which have been persistent for a long time.
